# Getting Started with Create React App

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). by typing following in the CLI

   > npx create-react-app

2. Then cd into the folder using CLI.

3. Axios is a library that allows us to easily configure API calls in Javascript and our React app. You can use a CDN or install it directly into your NPM project. To install it in your NPM project:

   > npm install axios

4. To install react router dependency inside the project folder, we can install this using npm, which gets us access to BrowserRouter, Routes and Route

   > npm install react-router-dom

5. useParams hook was used to acess the path variables (from react-router-dom) in the making of this webpage.
